# bitburner-scripts
These are my core basic scripts for automating in the game Bitburner (NS2).

## Basics
If you already have some progression, you can just start off with this script. Run it and let it do its thing and it will progressively upgrade (personal and hacknet servers only) and expand as far as it can. I've applied some base values that seem to work for me, you may wish to modify them.

`./build-empire.js`

It does not upgrade your home server, and it does not buy scripts on the black market. Otherwise, the various scripts tend to focus on one purpose. 

At some point you'll likely want to kill the server upgrade scripts and save some coin for augments. For me these scripts were meant to just automate the redundant background things so that I can poke around and explore other things in the game. I'm still pretty early on myself, so this is just where I'm at so far.

Feel free to mix and match, modify, etc as you please. If you have some cool changes/suggestions, feel free to raise an issue or PR!
